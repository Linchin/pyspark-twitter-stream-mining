## Real-Time Twitter Mining with Apache Spark (PySpark)

###Motivation
I love python and I love Machine Learning, specially in real-time. Up to now, Apache Spark does not have any Twitter Stream integration, so I put up a little workaround to be able to use spark on twitter data. Even better, I integrated the result into visualizations. So far, there is only a d3 wordcloud but I am planning to add more.

###Getting Started
* Install Python if you are not already awesomely blessed by UNIX to have preinstalled it with you
* Make sure you have Apache Spark installed. This repo works with spark-1.5.1-bin-hadoop2.6 verison perfectly. After that, you just need to remember where you extracted spark, we call it $SPARK_HOME, Ogey?

* Get your API keys from [https://dev.twitter.com/](Twitter Developers) and put them in ```data/config.json```.

###Run Example
First, run the Socket Echo Server with the following command:

```bash
python sck.py
```

It will run a TCP server on port 9999, then run the twitter feed:

```bash
python tweet.py
```

Now submit the ```frequent_words.py``` to ```spark-submit```:

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit sparkjob.py
```

```bash

(u'url', 282)
(u'#python', 125)
(u'user', 102)
(u'como', 70)
(u'de', 59)
(u'con', 43)
(u'monty', 42)
(u'este', 36)
(u'culebra', 35)
...
```

After that, you are gonna have a stateful count of all realtime feed of twitter stream with most used words (stop words and non-alpha numeric words are striped). The log will show you the top 10 words sorted by number of appearence. Note that spark will create a folder called ```twitter-checkpoint```Â to keep state and failovers.


You should see the most frequent words in Tweets that have ```Python``` in them. Why Python? Becuase it's awesome! For now, change the query [here]().

###Real-time D3.js WordCloud

First, make sure that all the previous steps are running simultaneously. Then:

```bash
cd html

bower install

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```
Go to [http://localhost:9000]() and see the running wordcloud updating every 10 seoncds.
